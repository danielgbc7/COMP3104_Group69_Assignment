A DevOps course provides a comprehensive understanding of the practices and tools used to integrate development and IT operations for faster, 
more efficient software delivery. It typically covers key concepts such as continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure 
as code, and automation of testing and deployment processes. Students learn how to use modern tools like Git, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and 
cloud services to streamline workflows, reduce errors, and ensure high software quality. The course emphasizes collaboration between 
development and operations teams, fostering a culture of agility and adaptability in software development cycles. By the end, participants gain 
practical experience in setting up pipelines, managing cloud infrastructure, and implementing monitoring and feedback systems.
