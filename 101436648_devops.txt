COMP3104 - DevOps

DevOps is a collaborative approach that integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve software delivery efficiency and quality. 
By breaking down silos between teams, DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility.

Key practices include automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CI/CD), which streamline repetitive tasks and allow for rapid,
 reliable code deployment. Monitoring and feedback loops are emphasized, providing real-time data on application performance and user experience to inform future development.

Culturally, DevOps promotes transparency, continuous improvement, and team ownership, leading to greater job satisfaction and agility. 
The rise of cloud computing and containerization technologies has further enhanced DevOps practices, enabling faster time-to-market and improved product quality.
 Overall, DevOps helps businesses respond more effectively to market demands and enhance customer satisfaction.
