DevOps - Software Development Lifecycle
---------------------------------------

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used for planning, creating, 
testing, and deploying software applications. It provides a systematic framework to guide software development from conception to delivery, 
ensuring quality and efficiency throughout the project.

The SDLC typically consists of several phases. The first phase is Requirement Analysis, 
where stakeholders' needs are gathered and analyzed to understand what the software should achieve. 
Following this is the Planning phase, where the project scope, resources, timelines, and budget are defined, creating a roadmap for development.

The Design phase involves planning the software architecture and user interfaces, 
including both high-level design (overall system architecture) and low-level design (detailed specifications). 
Next is the Implementation (Coding) phase, where developers write the actual code based on the design specifications, 
translating design documents into a working software application.

Once coding is complete, the software undergoes the Testing phase, where it is rigorously tested to identify and fix defects. 
Various testing methods, such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, are employed to ensure the software meets the required standards. 
After testing, the software enters the Deployment phase, where it is installed and configured in the production environment for users to access, which may also involve training.

Finally, the software enters the Maintenance phase, where ongoing support, updates, and bug fixes are provided to ensure the software remains functional and relevant. 
Different methodologies can be applied within the SDLC, such as Agile, Waterfall, or DevOps, each offering unique approaches to managing the development process. 
By following the SDLC, organizations can enhance project visibility, reduce risks, and improve software quality, ultimately leading to better user satisfaction.
